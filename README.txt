Assignment 7: OOP Principles

Instructions: 
	-Create an abstract class called Item with a pure virtual function display(). 
	-Create two classes that inherit from Item: 
		-Perishable – override display() to print "Perishable Item" 
		-NonPerishable – override display() to print "Non-Perishable Item" 
	-In main(), use a pointer to the base class Item to call display() on both derived objects.
